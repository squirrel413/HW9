 * The queen is the master of the bee hive and the only bee that is allowed

 * mate with a drone if these two conditions are met:<br>
 * <br>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The bee hive has 1 unit of nectar and 1 unit of pollen</li>
 *     <li>There is a drone available and ready to do the wild thing</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * After the stimulating mating session which takes one unit of time,
 * the queen produces between 1 and 4 new bees (if resources exist).
 * Finally, the queen takes a break and smokes a cigarette and puts on some
 * netflix before she chills with her next drone.

     * and a drone has a 60% change of being created.  After all the bees
